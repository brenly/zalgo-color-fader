//generation methods:

//if it is left to right then the color begin and end should be able to happen outside all of the rand_zalgo for loops

//if it is top to bottom then start top color, mid, bottom all incrementally fading. 
//THIS MIGHT CREATE PROBLEMS! I BELIEVE TOP TEXT GENERATES FROM "BOTTOM" TO TOP (STARTING IN MIDLE POSITION)

//if it is bleeding out from the middle then start each top, mid, bottom at the start color

/// previews/ output method:

//do not add a plain zalgo preview! this is already well covered by other zalgo websites.

//add a background color modifier for the div. maybe 3-5 color choices for simplicty sake. white. black. grey. r, g, b
//color preview div
//as each colorized letter is added code-wise, generate that as a string and publish it to:
element.insertAdjacentHTML(position, text);

//html for the user to copy/paste
//and then publish it to: 
element.insertAdjacentText(position, element);
