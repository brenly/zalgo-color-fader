# zalgo-color-fader
# This is my first ever javascript project! It is a simple zalgo text generator combined with an html color fader. The vertical html color fade barely works at present. I've tried a few different creative ways to work around those limitations but will still have to put in hours to solve that. It's a limitation of HTML5 at present.
